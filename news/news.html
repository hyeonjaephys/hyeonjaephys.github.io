    <h4>[Jun 2025] APS DAMOP Meeting</h4>
    <p>I attended the 56th annual meeting of APS Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (DAMOP) in Portland, Oregon. I presented a poster on Lifetime extension in Rubidium vapor cells by Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coating and also contributed as a co-author to another poster on Demonstration of atom spin gyroscope operating with high bandwidth over 100 Hz.</p>
    <p>This was my first international conference, and it was a valuable experience where I learned a great deal through diverse talks and discussions with researchers. Portland was a relaxed and free-spirited city with beautiful weather, which made the experience even more memorable. Thanks to everyone who attended and engaged in great discussions!</p>

    <h4>[Jun 2024] Appointment at the Agency for Defense Development (ADD)</h4>
    <p>I started as a Research Officer for National Defense (ROND) in 3rd R&D Institute, conducting atom-based quantum sensor research for the next three years.</p>
    <p>I'm also a Second Lieutenant in the Republic of Korea Air Force. The Research Officers for National Defense program, modeled after Israel's Talpiot, annually selects around twenty top-ranked undergraduates (including two in physics) to serve their military duty through research at the Agency for Defense Development.</p>
