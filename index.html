  <h2 class="section-title">About me</h2>
  
  <div class="entry about-text">
    <p>
      I am a Researcher (<a href="https://rond.or.kr" target="_blank">Research Officer for National Defense</a>) at <a href="https://www.add.re.kr" target="_blank">Agency for Defense Development</a> in Daejeon, South Korea.<br>
      My research currently focuses on quantum sensing based on atomic vapor cells—particularly on optically atomic pumped magnetometers (OPAMs) and NMR gyroscopes—using atomic spectroscopy as a principal experimental method. I also conduct research on atomic–light interactions as a fundamental topic in AMO physics.
    </p>
    <p>
      My broader research interests include quantum simulation, quantum computing, and quantum sensing using ultracold quantum gases.
      I am also interested in neutral-atom platforms more broadly, especially in their applications to quantum many-body physics and quantum technologies.
      I hope to explore these directions further in future graduate studies (Ph.D applications planned for Fall 2027).

        This paper reports a high-temperature long-term aging test of Al₂O₃-coated cubic rubidium vapor cells, demonstrating a nearly fourfold extension in stable rubidium number density and a 4.6-times slower decay compared to uncoated cells.

        I attended the 56th annual meeting of APS Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (DAMOP) in Portland, Oregon. I presented a poster on Lifetime extension in rubidium vapor cells by Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coating and also contributed as a co-author to another poster on Demonstration of atom spin gyroscope operating with high bandwidth over 100 Hz.

        I'm also a Second Lieutenant in the Republic of Korea Air Force. The Research Officers for National Defense program, modeled after Israel's Talpiot, annually selects around twenty top-ranked undergraduates (including two in physics) to serve their military duty through research at the Agency for Defense Development.
