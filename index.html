  <h2 class="section-title">About me</h2>
  
  <div class="entry">
    I am a Researcher at <a href="https://www.add.re.kr" target="_blank">Agency for Defense Development</a> in Daejeon, South Korea.<br>
    My research currently focuses on quantum sensing based on atomic vapor cells—particularly on optically atomic pumped magnetometers (OPAMs) and NMR gyroscopes—using atomic spectroscopy as a principal experimental method. I also conduct research on atomic–light interactions as a fundamental topic in AMO physics.

    My broader research interests include quantum simulation, quantum computing, and quantum sensing using ultracold quantum gases. I am also interested in neutral-atom platforms more broadly, especially in their applications to quantum many-body physics and quantum technologies. I hope to explore these directions further in future graduate studies (Ph.D applications planned for Fall 2027).

        I attended the 56th annual meeting of APS Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (DAMOP) in Portland, Oregon. I presented a poster on Lifetime extension in rubidium vapor cells by Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coating and also contributed as a co-author to another poster on Demonstration of atom spin gyroscope operating with high bandwidth over 100 Hz.

        This was my first international conference, and it was a valuable experience where I learned a great deal through diverse talks and discussions with researchers. Portland was a relaxed and free-spirited city with beautiful weather, which made the experience even more memorable. Thanks to everyone who attended and engaged in great discussions!

        I'm also a Second Lieutenant in the Republic of Korea Air Force. The Research Officers for National Defense program, modeled after Israel's Talpiot, annually selects around twenty top-ranked undergraduates (including two in physics) to serve their military duty through research at the Agency for Defense Development.
