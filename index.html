  <div class="entry about-text">
    <p>
      I am a Researcher (<a href="https://rond.or.kr" target="_blank">Research Officer for National Defense</a>) at <a href="https://www.add.re.kr" target="_blank">Agency for Defense Development</a> in Daejeon, South Korea.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research currently focuses on quantum sensing based on atomic vapor cells—particularly on optically atomic pumped magnetometers (OPAMs) and NMR gyroscopes—using atomic spectroscopy as a principal experimental method.
      I also conduct research on atomic–light interactions as a fundamental topic in AMO physics.
    </p>
    <p>
      My broader research interests include quantum simulation, quantum computing, and quantum sensing using ultracold quantum gases.
      I am also interested in neutral-atom platforms more broadly, especially in their applications to quantum many-body physics and quantum technologies.
      I hope to explore these directions further in future graduate studies (Ph.D applications planned for Fall 2027).

        This paper reports a high-temperature long-term aging test of Al₂O₃-coated cubic rubidium vapor cells, demonstrating a nearly fourfold extension in stable rubidium number density and a 4.6-times slower decay compared to uncoated cells.

        I was appointed as a researcher (Research Officer for National Defense) in the Emerging Science and Technology Directorate at the Agency for Defense Development (three-year term, ending May 31, 2027), where I conduct research on atom-based quantum sensing.

        The Research Officer for National Defense (ROND) program selects 20 research officers nationwide for STEM-based national defense research, through which mandatory military service is fulfilled by conducting full-time research at the Agency for Defense Development (similar in structure to Israel’s Talpiot program).
