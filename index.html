  <h2 class="section-title">About me</h2>
  
  <div class="entry">
    I am a Researcher at <a href="https://www.add.re.kr" target="_blank">Agency for Defense Development</a> in Daejeon, South Korea.<br>
    My research currently focuses on quantum sensing based on atomic vapor cells—particularly on optically atomic pumped magnetometers (OPAMs) and NMR gyroscopes—using atomic spectroscopy as a principal experimental method. I also conduct research on atomic–light interactions as a fundamental topic in AMO physics.

    My broader research interests include quantum simulation, quantum computing, and quantum sensing using ultracold quantum gases. I am also interested in neutral-atom platforms more broadly, especially in their applications to quantum many-body physics and quantum technologies. I hope to explore these directions further in future graduate studies (Ph.D applications planned for Fall 2027).
