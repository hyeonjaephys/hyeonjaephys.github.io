<p>We conducted a long-term aging test at high temperature on cubic glass rubidium vapor cells. The inner surface of the cubic glass cell was coated with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> using electron beam deposition, resulting in a thickness of 26.9 nm on the side walls and 63.8 nm on the bottom surface. The rubidium number density was monitored by measuring the absorption spectrum of the D<sub>1</sub> line. The measured spectrum was compared with a simulated profile based on the Beer Lambert law. The rubidium number density in the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-coated rubidium vapor cell remained constant for nearly four times longer and then decreased 4.6 times more slowly than in the uncoated rubidium vapor cell.</p>
