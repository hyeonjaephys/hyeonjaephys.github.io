<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="abstract-container">
<p>We conducted a long-term aging test at high temperature on cubic glass rubidium vapor cells. The inner surface of the cubic glass cell was coated with Al2O3 using electron beam deposition, resulting in a thickness of 26.9 nm on the side walls and 63.8 nm on the bottom surface. The rubidium number density was monitored by measuring the absorption spectrum of the D1 line. The measured spectrum was compared with a simulated profile based on the Beer Lambert law. The rubidium number density in the Al2O3-coated rubidium vapor cell remained constant for nearly four times longer and then decreased 4.6 times more slowly than in the uncoated rubidium vapor cell.</p>
