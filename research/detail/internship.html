<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="abstract-container">
  <p>We present a fabrication method for a flexible PEC cell with a bismuth vanadate (BiVO₄) photoanode. We developed a sol-gel solution suitable for coating onto an ITO-PEN substrate and optimized an annealing process on a hot plate to convert the precursor into BiVO₄. Subsequently, laser crystallization was employed to successfully transform the precursor deposited on the ITO-PEN substrate into crystalline BiVO₄. The deposition of BiVO₄ was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Using the fabricated flexible BiVO₄ photoanode, we successfully achieved hydrogen production via water splitting, obtaining a water oxidation current density of 0.45 mA/cm² from the developed sample.</p>
