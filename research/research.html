    <strong class="entry-title">Quantum Sensing</strong>
    <p>
      My current research focuses on quantum sensing implemented with hot alkali vapor cells, such as OPMs and NMR gyroscopes. I am further interested in precision-measurement platforms including NV centers—offering high spatial resolution and robustness—and ultracold quantum gases, which provide quantum-limited sensitivity and controllable many-body dynamics.

    <strong class="entry-title">Quantum Simulation and Quantum Computing</strong>
    <p>
      I am interested in quantum simulation and quantum computing using ultracold atomic gases and neutral-atom platforms. These systems offer tunable interactions, long coherence times, and programmable many-body Hamiltonians, enabling controlled studies of quantum many-body physics and the development of scalable quantum architectures.

    <h4>Aging test of atomic vapor cells</h4>
    <p>
      This study evaluated the long-term stability of cubic glass atomic vapor cells through high-temperature aging tests.
      Furthermore, it presented the first quantitative demonstration that introducing an Al2O3 coating on the inner walls of the cubic glass atomic vapor cells can reduce rubidium consumption and contribute to lifetime extension.

    <h4>Optically Pumped Magenetometer (OPM)</h4>
    <p>
    This research analyzes various physical phenomena arising from atomic–light interactions within an optically pumped magnetometer (OPM), using both theoretical modeling and experimental measurements. In particular, we aim to realize the spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) regime and use the resulting setup to study magnetic noise sources. These efforts support the development of low-SWaP (size, weight, and power) OPMs suitable for practical sensing applications.
